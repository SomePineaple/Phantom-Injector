# Phantom Injector
This is a graphical .so injector made specifically for the
[Phantom ghost client](https://github.com/SomePineaple/Phantom). You can either build the app from source here, or you
can download the AppImage from the releases tab. If you build from source, make sure to run the built binary as root, or
you won't be able to inject.

## Licencing
